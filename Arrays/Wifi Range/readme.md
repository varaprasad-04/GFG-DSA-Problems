There are n rooms in a straight line in Geekland State University's hostel. You are given a binary string s of length n, where s[i] = '1' means there is a WiFi router in the i-th room, and s[i] = '0' means there is no WiFi in that room.

Each WiFi router has a range of x, meaning it can cover up to x rooms to its left and x rooms to its right.

Given x and s, determine whether all rooms are covered by at least one WiFi router. Return true if all rooms are covered; otherwise, return false.

Examples:

Input: x = 0, s = "010"
Output: false
Explanation: Since the range is 0, so Wifi is only accessible in second room while 1st & 3rd room have no wifi. Therefore answer is false for this test case.
Input: x = 1, s = "10010"
Output: true
Explanation:
Index 0: WiFi is available.
Index 1: Since the range of the 0th index is 1, WiFi is available here.
Index 2: Since the range of the 3rd index is 1, WiFi is also available here.
Index 3: WiFi is available.
Index 4: The range of the 3rd index covers this position.
So, all the rooms have WiFi. Therefore, the answer is true for this test case.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ x ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
