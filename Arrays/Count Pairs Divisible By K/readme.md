Given an array arr[] and positive integer k, count total number of pairs in the array whose sum is divisible by k.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [2, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3], k = 4
Output : 5
Explanation : There are five pairs possible whose sum is divisible by '4' i.e., (2, 2), (1, 7), (7, 5), (1, 3) and (5, 3).
Input : arr[] = [5, 9, 36, 74, 52, 31, 42], k = 3
Output : 7
Explanation : There are seven pairs whose sum is divisible by 3, i.e, (9, 36), (9,42), (74, 52), (36, 42), (74, 31), (31, 5) and (5, 52).
Constraints :
1 ≤ |arr| ≤ 5*104
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ 5*104
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(k)
