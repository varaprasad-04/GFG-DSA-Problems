Given an array arr[] containing positive integers, return the maximum length of the bitonic subarray.

A subarray arr[i...j] is considered bitonic if its elements first monotonically increase, and then monotonically decrease. Formally, there exists an index k (where i <= k <= j) such that:

arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= . . . <= arr[k]
arr[k] >= arr[k+1] >= . . . >= arr[j]
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 4, 78, 90, 45, 23]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest bitonic subarray is [4, 78, 90, 45, 23], it starts increasing at 4, peaks at 90, and decreases to 23, giving length of 5.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array [10, 20, 30, 40] is striclty increasing with no decreasing part, so longest bitonic subarray is the entire array itself, giving a length of 4.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10, 10]
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
