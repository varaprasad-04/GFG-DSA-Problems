Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.

A BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node's data.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node's data.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.

Examples:

Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]

Output: true
Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller data and right subtree of every node contains greater data. Hence, the tree is a BST.
Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9]

Output: false
Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with data 7 has lesser value 6, hence it is not a valid BST.
