Given a binary tree having n nodes, find the vertical sum of the nodes that are in the same vertical line. Return all sums through different vertical lines starting from the left-most vertical line to the right-most vertical line.

Examples:

Input:

Output:
4 2 12 3 7
Explanation:

The tree has 5 vertical lines
Line 1 has only one node 4 => vertical sum is 4.
Line 2 has only one node 2 => vertical sum is 2.
Line-3 has three nodes: 1,5,6 => vertical sum is 1+5+6 = 12.
Line-4 has only one node 3 => vertical sum is 3.
Line-5 has only one node 7 => vertical sum is 7.
Input:

Output:
7 6 4 3 2 1
Explanation:
There are six vertical lines each having one node.
Constraints:
1<=n<=104
1<= Node value <= 105
