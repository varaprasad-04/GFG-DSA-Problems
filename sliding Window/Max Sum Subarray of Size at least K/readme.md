Given an array arr[] and an integer k, find the maximum sum among all contiguous subarrays having a length greater than or equal to k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 2, -3], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The sub-array of length at least 3 that produces greatest sum is [1, -2, 2]
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The sub-array of length at least 2 that produces greatest sum is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Input: arr[] = [-4, -2, 1, -3], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: The sub-array of length at least 2 that produces greatest sum is [-2, 1]

Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
-104 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
