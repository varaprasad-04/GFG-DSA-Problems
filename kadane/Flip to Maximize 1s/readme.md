Given an array arr[] consisting of 0’s and 1’s. A flip operation involves changing all 0's to 1's and all 1's to 0's within a contiguous subarray. Formally, select a range (l, r) in the array arr[], such that (0 ≤ l ≤ r < n) holds and flip the elements in this range.

Return the maximum number of 1's you can get in the array after doing at most 1 flip operation.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Output: 4
Explanation: By flipping the subarray from index 1 to 2, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This results in a total of 4 ones, which is the maximum possible after at most one flip.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: By flipping the subarray from index 1 to 5, the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This results in a total of 6 ones, which is the maximum possible after at most one flip.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
