Given a fence with n posts and k colours, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colours.
Answers are guaranteed to be fit into a 32 bit integer.

Examples:

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Let the 2 colours be 'R' and 'B'. We have following possible combinations:

1. RRB
2. RBR
3. RBB
4. BRR
5. BRB
6. BBR
   Input: n = 2, k = 4
   Output: 16
   Explanation: After coloring first post with 4 possible combinations, you can still color next posts with all 4 colors. Total possible combinations will be 4x4=16
   Constraints:
   1 ≤ n ≤ 300
   1 ≤ k ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
