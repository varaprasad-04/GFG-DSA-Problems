Given two strings, s1 and s2, count the number of subsequences of string s1 equal to string s2.

Return the total count modulo 1e9+7.

Examples :

Input: s1 = "geeksforgeeks", s2 = "gks"
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick characters from s1 as a subsequence from indices [0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 12], [0, 11, 12] and [8, 11, 12]. So total 4 subsequences of s1 that are equal to s2.
Input: s1 = "problemoftheday", s2 = "geek"
Output: 0
Explanation: No subsequence of string s1 is equal to string s2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 103
