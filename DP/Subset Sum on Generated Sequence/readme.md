There are n children standing in a queue, each assigned a number arr[i]. The teacher writes s on a paper and gives it to the first child.

Each child writes the sum of all numbers already on the paper and arr[i], then passes it to the next child.

Return true if x can be formed by adding some of the numbers written on the paper: else return false.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 2], s = 1, x = 7
Output: true
Explanation: The first student gets 1 on paper and writes 2. The second student gets [1, 2] and writes 5. The third student gets [1, 2, 5] and writes 12. The final sequence of numbers on the paper is 1, 2, 5, 12, 22. Using 2 and 5 we can form 7.
Input: arr[] = [51, 88], s = 100, x = 500
Output: false
Explanation: The final sequence of numbers on the paper is 100, 151, 339. Using these numbers we cannot form 500.
Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
1 ≤ s ≤ 109
0 ≤ x ≤ 109
Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
