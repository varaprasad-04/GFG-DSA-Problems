Given a number n, find the total number of Derangements of elements from 1 to n. A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that no element appears in its original position, i.e., 1 should not be the first element, 2 should not be second, etc. For example, [5, 3, 2, 1, 4] is a Derangement of first 5 elements.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: For [1, 2], there is only one possible derangement: [2, 1].
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: For the set [1, 2, 3], there are only two possible derangements: [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2].
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 12

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
